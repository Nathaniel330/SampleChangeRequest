# SampleChangeRequest

We need to update our Sample Eligibility change request dialogue to check whether the Account has a populated fax number. If it doesn't, we need to force the user to provide one before they can submit the change request.

Can we:
Make fax number required for them to submit the Sample change request
Indicate that the fax number is required in order for the provider to receive samples. "Fax number (used for sampling AOC's) is required for the provider to receive samples"
